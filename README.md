velocimeter
===========

simple tiny android app for outputting GPS data


currently outputs:
elapsed time
distance traveled
current velocity
average velocity
numeric compass heading
cardinal 8-directional compass heading
latitude
longitude

can theoretically record that information to text file, as well, but that hasn't been tested yet
